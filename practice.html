        <p id="info">Kombucha is a fermented tea that has been consumed for thousands of years.
          Not only does it have the same health benefits as tea â€” it's also rich in beneficial probiotics.
          Kombucha also contains antioxidants, can kill harmful bacteria and may help fight several diseases.</p>

        <p id="more-info">Kombucha is thought to originate in China or Japan.
          It's made by adding specific strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to black or green tea, then allowing it to ferment for a week or more.
          During this process, bacteria and yeast form a mushroom-like film on the surface of the liquid. This is why kombucha is also known as "mushroom tea."
          This blob is a living symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast, or a SCOBY, and can be used to ferment new kombucha.
          The fermentation process produces acetic acid (also found in vinegar) and several other acidic compounds, trace levels of alcohol and gases that make it carbonated.
          A large amount of bacteria also grow in the mixture. Although there is still no evidence for the probiotic benefits of kombucha, it contains several species of lactic-acid bacteria which may have probiotic function.
          Probiotics provide your gut with healthy bacteria. These bacteria can improve many aspects of health, including digestion, inflammation and even weight loss.
          For this reason, adding beverages like kombucha to your diet might improve your health in many ways.</p>
